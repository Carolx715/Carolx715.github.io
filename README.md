## Inspiration
I decided I needed a personal website with my resume and linkedin and GitHub, so I decided to make one.

## How it was built
Built from ground up using basic HTML/CSS/JS. 

## Challenges
* Mainly, trying to make it compatible with all or most devices. Still working on that occasionally, but by now it seems to display well on most devices except the iPad (on landscape mode) and larger screens.
